The RememberBees study we're trying to run works as follows: give people a
video, ~ 5 minutes, ask them to remember the speaker's name, and ask them some
other questions. We think it'll be difficult to remember the speaker's name.
Then we'll give them a phone app that will help them remember names, and we
think it'll be easier to remember names with that app.

The tricky thing is, if you just give people a video and say "remember the
speaker's name", it's not hard. So this pilot project aims to get the task
online, and then we can use Mechanical Turk to pilot people quickly and
cheaply. We tried to put questions during the talk and introduce background
crowd noise to make it a little more distracting.
